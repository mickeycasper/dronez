# Dronez! Sample app for PakEnergy

## Running the app

Run `npm i` to install app dependencies.

Run `ng serve` to spin up the dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Note: look for these files to see the relevant drone code stuff:

`dronez.component.ts`
`dronez.component.html`
`drone-distributor-service`

You'll see other interfaces, a pipe and a few other things used here in the app, but to see the main gist, those should get ya going in the right direction!

Reach out to me with ANY questions! And of course if you'd like me to tweak or further update anything let me know! I may end up adding on-screen drone and package managment if I get bored!

Talk to you soon...
